# Introduction

The data frame `college_bball` contains a subset of college basketball data that is available online via <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset> It contains a wide variety of division 1 college basketball team statistics from 2013 to 2023


# Data


## Summary Statistics

```{r}

rmarkdown::paged_table(college_bball) 

```


```{r}
skim(college_bball) %>% 
  select(-n_missing)
```


## Visualization


### Field Goal Percentages Part 1

What 5 teams have the highest field goal percentages `EFG_O`?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
top_5_teams <- college_bball %>%
  arrange(desc(EFG_O)) %>%
  head(5)
specific_teams1 <- c("Gonzaga", "UCLA", "Villanova", "William & Mary", "South Dakota St.")
top_5_data <- subset(college_bball, TEAM %in% specific_teams1)

ggplot(data = top_5_data) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = TEAM, y = EFG_O))
```
Gonzaga shows the highest average field goal percentage among division 1 college basketball teams



### Field Goal Percentages Part 2

What 5 teams have the lowest field goal percentages `EFG_O`?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
bottom_5_teams <- college_bball %>%
  arrange(EFG_O) %>%
  head(5)
specific_teams2 <- c("Howard", "Grambling St.", "Northern Illinois", "Maryland Eastern Shore", "Delaware St.")
bottom_5_data <- subset(college_bball, TEAM %in% specific_teams2)

ggplot(data = bottom_5_data) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = TEAM, y = EFG_O))
```
Maryland Eastern Shore shows the lowest average field goal percentages among division 1 college basketball teams


### Turnovers

What 5 teams have the highest turnover percentages `TOR`?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
top_5 <- college_bball %>%
  arrange(desc(TOR)) %>%
  head(5)
specific_teams3 <- c("Savannah St.", "Grambling St.", "IUPUI", "Arkansas Pine Bluff", "Manhattan")
top_5 <- subset(college_bball, TEAM %in% specific_teams3)

ggplot(data = top_5) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = TEAM, y = TOR))
```
Arkansas Pine Bluff shows the highest average turnover percentages among division 1 college basketball teams 

### Power Ratings

What 5 teams have the highest chances of beating an average division 1 team `BARTHAG`?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
top_5_power <- college_bball %>%
  arrange(desc(BARTHAG)) %>%
  head(5)
specific_teams4 <- c("Kentucky", "Gonzaga", "Duke", "Wisconsin", "Louisville")
top_5_power <- subset(college_bball, TEAM %in% specific_teams4)

ggplot(data = top_5_power) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = TEAM, y = BARTHAG))
```
Gonzaga shows the highest chances of beating an average division 1 college basketball team among all division 1 college basketball teams


### Field Goal Percentage vs Winning

What is the relationship between field goal percentage `EFG_O` and the number of games won `W`?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = college_bball) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = EFG_O, y = W))
```
There is a positive relationship between field goal percentage and number of games won. So, as a team increases their field goal percentage, they will most likely win more games
